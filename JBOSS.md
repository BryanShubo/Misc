Table 2.3. Configuration File Locations
```
Server mode	Location	Purpose
domain.xml	EAP_HOME/domain/configuration/domain.xml	This is the main configuration file for a managed domain. Only the domain master reads this file. On other domain members, it can be removed.
host.xml	EAP_HOME/domain/configuration/host.xml	This file includes configuration details specific to a physical host in a managed domain, such as network interfaces, socket bindings, the name of the host, and other host-specific details. The host.xml file includes all of the features of both host-master.xml and host-slave.xml, which are described below. This file is not present for standalone servers.
host-master.xml	EAP_HOME/domain/configuration/host-master.xml	This file includes only the configuration details necessary to run a server as a managed domain master server. This file is not present for standalone servers.
host-slave.xml	EAP_HOME/domain/configuration/host-slave.xml	This file includes only the configuration details necessary to run a server as a managed domain slave server. This file is not present for standalone servers.
standalone.xml	EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone.xml	This is the default configuration file for a standalone server. It contains all information about the standalone server, including subsystems, networking, deployments, socket bindings, and other configurable details. This configuration is used automatically when you start your standalone server.
standalone-full.xml	EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full.xml	This is an example configuration for a standalone server. It includes support for every possible subsystem except for those required for high availability. To use it, stop your server and restart using the following command: EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full.xml
standalone-ha.xml	EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-ha.xml	This example configuration file enables all of the default subsystems and adds the mod_cluster and JGroups subsystems for a standalone server, so that it can participate in a high-availability or load-balancing cluster. This file is not applicable for a managed domain. To use this configuration, stop your server and restart using the following command: EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-ha.xml
standalone-full-ha.xml	EAP_HOME/standalone/configuration/standalone-full-ha.xml	This is an example configuration for a standalone server. It includes support for every possible subsystem, including those required for high availability. To use it, stop your server and restart using the following command: EAP_HOME/bin/standalone.sh -c standalone-full-ha.xml
