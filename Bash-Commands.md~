##Bash Commands:

Creating a cheating command list.
```
Basic Operations:
Relative pathname: .(present directory)   ..(parent directory)   ~(home directory)
cd // change to home directory
cd .. // change to upper directory
cd - // change to previous directory
cd /  // change to root directory
pwd // present working directory
cat
echo
ls // list the contents in pwd
ls -a // list all files including hidden files and folders
tree // display a tree view of the filesystem
tree -d // display a tree view for the current directory
man
exit
login: ssh username@remote-server.com // secure shell(SSH)

```

Searching for files
```
locate // get the directory of a file
updatedb
wildcard: ? // match any single character
          * // match any string of characters
          [set] // matches any character in the set of characters
          [!set] // matches any character not in the set of characters
find // list all files in the current and all of its subdirectories.
find -type (f //regular file, d // directory, I // symbolic link)
find -name (files with certain pattern)
find -iname (ignore the case of file names)
find -name "*.md" -exec rm {} ';' // find and remove all of files with ".md"
find -ctime 3
find -atime
find -mtime
find -size +10M  // + means greater, - means less, without + or - means exact number
find / // find everything from root directory
grep

```

Working with files
```
cat // view the file without scroll-back
tac // look at the file backwards, starting with the last line
less // view the file with scroll-back
tail // print last 10 lines by default
head // print first 10 lines by default


mkdir // create a directory
touch // used to set or update the access, change, and modify times of files.
touch <filename> // create an empty file

mv // rename a file or folder
rm <filename> // remove a file
rm -f <filename> // forcefully remove a file
rm -i <filename> // interactively remove a file
rmdir // only remove an empty dirctory
rm -rf // forcefully remove a directory recursively

sudo apt-cache search <software_name>
sudo apt-get install <software_name>
sudo apt-get remove <software_name>
sudo apt-get upgrade <software_name>
```

Comparing files and file types
```
diff <filename1> <filename2>
diff -c // provides a listing of differences that include 3 lines of context before and after the lines differing in content
diff -i // ignore the case of letters
diff -w // ignore differences in spaces and tabs (white space)
diff -r // used to recursively compare subdirectories as well as the current directory
diff3 // comparing three files at once

file <filename or folder> // determin type of files
```

Backing up and compressing data
```
cp // can only copy files to and from destinations on the local machine
rsync // can also copy files from one machine to another.
rsync -r project-x archive-machine:archives/project-x

gzip * // compress all files in the current directory; each file is compresssed and renamed with a .gz extension
gzip -r projectX // compress all files in the projectX directory along with all files in all of the directories under projectX
gunzip fool // De-compress foo found in the file foo.gz. under the hood, gunzip command is actually the same as gzip -d

bzip2 *
bunzip2 *.bz2 // the same as bzip2 -d

xz *
xz foo
xz -dkbar.xz
xy -dcf a.txt b.txt.xz > abcd.txt
xz -d *.xz

zip backup *
zip -r back.zip ~
unzip backup.zip

tar scf mydir.tar
tar zcvf mydir.tar.gz mydir
tar jcvf mydir.tar.bz2 mydir
tar Jcvf mydir.tar.bz2 mydir
tar xvf mydir.tar.gz

disk-to-disk copying

```

User Environment
```
who // list current logged-on users
who -a // list all information
whoami // to identify the current user

sudo useradd turkey
id // list current user information

// adding and removing group
sudo /usr/sbin/groupadd newGroup
sudo /usr/sbin/groupdel groupName

groups user // check user group
sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -G groupName user // add user to group

//view current set environment variables
set
env
export

//setting environment variables
echo $SHELL // show the value of a specific varible
export VARIABLE=value (or VARIABLE = value; export VARIABLE) // export a new variable value
//add a variable permanently
1. edit ~/.bashrc and add the line export Variable=value
2. type source ~/.bashrc or bash

//PATH variable
export PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH

//Keyboard shortcut
ctrl + L //clears the screen
ctrl + D // exits the current shell
ctrl + Z // puts the current process into suspended background
ctrl + C // kills the current process
ctrl + H // works the same as backspace
ctrl + A // goes to the beginning of the line
ctrl + W // deletes the word before the cursor
ctrl + U // delets from beginning of line to cursor position
ctrl + E // goes to the end of the line
TAB // auto-completes files, directories, and binaries


// file permissions
chown // Used to change user ownership of a file or directory
chgrp // used to change group ownership
chmod // used to change the permissions on the file which can be done separately for owner, group and the rest of the world.

rwx: rwx : rwx // read, write, and execute
u:    g:    o // user, group, and other

chmod o+w, o-r test.java // add write to other; remove r from other
ls -l <fileName> // check permission privilege; information of fileName with long version.

4 read permission, 2 writer permission, 1 execution permission
chmod 777 test.java

sudo chown root test.java
sudo chgrp dev test.java

```

```
Text Editors

//method1: create myfile
cat <<EOF > myfile
line one
line two
line three
EOF

//method2
echo lineone > myfile
echo linetwo >> myfile
echo linethree >> myfile


//vim
i // insert mode
: // line command mode

vi myfile // start the vi and edit the myfile
vi -r myfile// start the vi and edit myfile in recovery mode from a system crash.
:r file2 // read in file2 and insert at current position
:w //writer to file
:w myfile // write out the file to myfile
:w! file2 //overwrite file2
:x  or :wq // exit vi and write out modified file
:q // quit vi
:q! //quit vi even though modifications have not been saved

```

Security principles
```
last // shows the last time each user logged into the system, which can be used to hlep identify potentially inactive accounts which are candidates for system removal

useradd <userName>
passwd <userName>

```
